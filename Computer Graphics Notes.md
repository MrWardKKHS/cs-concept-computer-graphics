# Introduction
You will be required to respond in short and / or extended answers (800–1500 words in total) to questions relating to Computer Graphics computer science concept.

EXAM QUESTIONS MAY COVER:
- matrices and transformations, 
- line and circle drawing, 
- line and circle algorithms, 
- graphics algorithms
- image rendering,
- lighting.

Resources (case studies and / or other information) will be provided, and the questions will refer to these.

Questions will prompt you to show insight into Computer Graphics  by:
- exploring less-obvious implications
- making and justifying predictions
- suggesting potential improvements.

You may use words, numerical workings, and diagrams in your responses to show your reasoning.

# Analysing Computer Graphics - Achieved

## Key Aspects of Computer Graphics 

- [[matrices and transformations]]
- [[line and circle drawing]]
- [[line and circle algorithms]]
- [[graphics algorithms]]
- [[image rendering]]
- [[lighting]]
- [[Relevant algorithms or other mechanisms behind Computer Graphics]]
- [[How Computer Graphics is used implemented or occurs]]
- [[Key problems related to Computer Graphics and how these have been or may be addressed]]

# In depth analysis of Computer Graphics - Merit

>[!hint] Candidates who were awarded MERIT commonly:
>- showed fundamental understanding of the area chosen, and were able to explain how this area related to people
>- articulated clearly more than one perspective and provided realistic and accurate examples
>- explained the technical components within their provided examples
>- explained how the area related to humans without solely or overwhelmingly focussing on hypothetical social outcomes
>- provided student voice based on their examples   
> - provided reasoned and accurate explanations
- [[Technical capabilities and limitations of Computer Graphics]]
- [[Different Perspectives of Computer Graphics]]

# Critically analysing Computer Graphics - Excellence
>[!hint] Candidates who were awarded Excellence commonly:
> - drew accurate conclusions linked to their earlier responses
> - argued why their conclusions were valid, true, applicable or correct
> - drew conclusions that showed the candidate comprehensively understood the area they were discussing
> - criticised the area objectively 
> - linked their insightful conclusions to their previous answers rather than postulating new technologies, or knowledges, or outcomes, without providing a premise for a train of reasoning.

> [!info] Examples of insightful conclusions include:
>- innovative and imaginative connections
>- exploration of less obvious implications
>- making justified predictions
>- suggesting improvements
>- making justified generalisations that could be applied beyond the area itself
>- use of higher level thinking skills such as synthesis
